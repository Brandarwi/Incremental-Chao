Incremental Chao
By Brandarwi
v0.1.2AR
(alpha release, 0.1 in mod.ini)

This mod drastically changes chao levels and stats progression.
DO NOT use on your regular chao save without a backup.
Or use a new chao save.

This mod passively generates rings and stats for your chaos.  The leveling up process is rebalanced so that gameplay is focused more on playing with the chaos rather than farming animals and grinding level 99.

How it works:
The stat cap is indicated by the level on the chao.  The level is the percentage of the max.  It can be increased by leveling with animals and drives.
Leveling is permanent!
Stat generation can be increased by getting a beginner medal and feeding different animals to each chao.
Ring generation is affected by beginner medal and is doubled while chao is racing.

Options:
Ring multiplier: can increase ring generation rate, or turn it off.
Stat multiplier: can increase chao stat generation rate, or turn it off. Or turn it up if enable all gardens is off.
Experience multiplier: increase the amount of experience chao get (from animals and drives)
Enable All Gardens: All chao will generate stats, regardless of the garden you are playing in. (might reduce performance, testing needed)
Animal and Drive: not implemented.

Compatibility:
Should work with CWExtended/x grades.
May break if leveling beyond level cap is on, I haven't tested.
Not sure how well this mod will perform with over 8 chao in the garden at once. Feel free to test.
Should also be compatible with EnhancedCW
And the editor.

Alpha notes:
Performance may not be the best on this release because I used a workaround method until I figure out some of the more complicated modding stuff.
Feedback on balance is appreciated.
The loop runs every half a second, so if you make an xp change and exit the garden within that time frame it won't save.
For correct saving, temporarily for the alpha version the mod uses the 8th chao stat (not in vanilla).  Other mods that use that data will be incompatible (CWE and ECW are fine, there probably aren't any mods that use it)

INSTALLATION:
get the SA2Modloader and put this with the rest in ..\Sonic Adventure 2\mods\Incremental Chao
